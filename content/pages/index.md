    subtitle: About me
    text: >+
      <div style="text-align: left">I’m transitioning from a background in
      psychology to a career in tech,

      combining my love for understanding people with a passion for data and

      technology. My first encounter with tech came during GCSEs when I built a

      website for an animal shelter. I didn’t realise it then, but it planted a
      seed.

      After university, where I achieved a First in all my statistics modules, I

      rediscovered that interest through Code First Girls’ Introduction to
      Python

      course.I’ve always enjoyed connecting with people and solving problems.
      From

      running my own stand selling pre-loved items to sharing ideas that inspire

      others, I’ve realised I have a natural drive for communication, growth,
      and

      curiosity. I’m drawn to both tech sales and data analysis because in
      sales, I

      love communicating the value of technology and helping others see its

      potential, while data analysis challenges me to think critically and
      explore

      the “why” behind things.I’m currently expanding my skills through a data
      analytics bootcamp and

      Kickstarter courses. Along the way, I’ve created projects in Python, SQL,
      and

      Tableau that explore data, uncover insights, and shape data-driven

      recommendations. What excites me most about technology is how
      it                                                                                                                           
      stimulates me to keep learning and to bridge the gap between people and
      data.</div>

        subtitle: Where curiosity began
        text: >
          I've always had a love for literature, from annotating to analysing
          novels. I was torn between studying English Literature or Psychology
          at university. In the end, I chose Psychology because I have always
          been intrinsically fascinated by human behaviour.


          While I enjoyed the subject, I was uncertain about where it would take
          me. I didn’t have a predefined career path, but one thing stood out: I
          consistently excelled in statistics. It made me wonder if I’d chosen
          the right field and whether my problem-solving and analytical skills
          would have thrived more in computer science.


          After graduating, I decided to explore that curiosity further and
          completed a Python course with Code First Girls. I loved every moment
          of it, from the thinking to the reasoning, and adding my own twist of
          creativity to turn ideas into something tangible and meaningful.

        subtitle: The Job Stuff
        text: >+
          In my final year of university, I worked as a teaching assistant. It
          was a refreshing and rewarding experience, and in many ways, my desire
          to teach manifested itself through every “aha” moment I witnessed. I
          loved seeing students’ confidence grow and discovering creative ways
          to make learning engaging. After graduating, I secured a place on the
          Teach First

          graduate scheme, but shortly after being accepted, I realised I needed
          more. While I enjoyed teaching, I also realised that the traditional
          classroom wasn’t where I was meant to stay. I wanted to keep learning,
          growing, and finding new

          ways to create impact beyond the school walls. Around the same time, I
          reached the final stage of the Think Ahead graduate scheme for social
          work. In the end, I chose to withdraw from both schemes, knowing how
          mentally and emotionally

          demanding those roles could be.

        subtitle: Faster
        text: >+
          Initially, what drew me to Teach First was the opportunity to take
          part in summer internships at Deloitte. I had always heard of the
          prestige surrounding the Big Four, and from a young age, I envisioned
          myself as a CEO. It reaffirmed my interest in the corporate world and
          made me realise I wanted a career that would challenge me
          intellectually and allow me to grow. To take my first step, I applied
          for recruitment roles to

          get my foot in the door, but I later realised it wasn’t the right fit.
          I reached the final stage of a graduate interview process and wasn’t
          selected, which gave me the space to pause and reflect. During that
          time, I explored different industries and networked with professionals
          who introduced me to the world of tech sales — something I had never
          heard of before. After completing a course called “How to Break into
          Tech Sales”, everything clicked. It felt like finding the missing
          piece of a puzzle I hadn’t seen before.

          Knowledge is power – something no one can take away from you. Every
          day brings new opportunities to learn and what you

          learn becomes part of who you are. Regardless of your background or
          circumstance, the mind is your greatest asset. With more knowledge,
          ignorance has no place. In other words, the more you learn, the more
          you grow and enrich your understanding of the world.
